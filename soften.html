This year in Software Engineering we are building an application for the Meals on Wheels programme, run by the St. Barnabas Trust. Initially, I believed the project would be somewhat trivial, even to the point of having to find another project to fill the semester. However, I quickly realised how complex even seemingly simple applications can become, particularly when attempting to build it in a large development team.

<h3>The class</h3>
<p>
The first thing I noticed was how different Software Engineering was from other classes I've taken. Whereas most other papers are focused on learning new skills, Software Engineering is all about applying those skills in new and unfamiliar situations. We decided that we would use <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" target="_blank">node.js</a> for our server, and <a href="https://angularjs.org/" target="_blank">Angular</a> for our front-end framework. I had never experienced either before, and was a little apprehensive about diving into something new. 
</p>
<p>
However, the structure of the lessons helped to cope with the unfamiliar: specifically, the practice of pair programming was very useful for approaching new situations. Basically, we worked in pairs (or sometimes three people) and fed off each others' expertise to find solutions to tricky problems. It seemed a little weird to me at first, and quite inefficient... why have two people working on one problem, when they could be tackling a problem each? But as we went along, I realised it was actually quite a powerful technique. We were writing better code, and my understanding of the languages we were using and our overall system architecture was improving by being able to check my ideas against other people's.
</p>
<p>
Pair programming is part of the Agile development methodologies, which also include things like sprints, scrums and the use of Trello as a Kanban board. In this class we attempted to use Agile approaches each time we got together as a group, but I don't think it really worked very well. The scrums in particular seemed to be a waste of time: nobody really had much to report from week to week, and I personally did not get much from the experience.
</p>
<p>
Since the structured Agile approaches weren't working as well as intended, I started thinking about the principles that lay at the heart of them: specifically, Agile seems focused on releasing working software as quickly as possible, and responding to changing requirements. I started to think about what this might mean in a general sense (not following a specific Agile protocol), and how I could better contribute to the project. Something that struck me as really important to 'being Agile' was effective and frequent communication with other people in the team: if everyone is aware of what everyone else is doing on the project, then we should be able to keep the software working at each stage of development and respond easily to new requirements. I believe this is the point of the weekly scrums, and keeping our processes and tasks transparent on our Trello board.

<p>
An area I thought might not be working as well as it could be was our Slack communication: Adon had set up a Slack channel for our class in the first weeks, but, five weeks in, no one had posted anything on the channel! To try and encourage better team communication, I started posting regularly to Slack - after every class, I would post up a brief summary of what I had worked on, with a link back to our Trello board. I challenged myself to also post at least once a week outside of class; I got into a habit of doing this by posting every Tuesday evening... this would usually also be some brief points about what I had been working on, but sometimes it was just general chit-chat with the team. I found that two things happened once I got into this regular posting habit:
  <ol>
    <li>it forced me to do more work outside of class... I found I <i>wanted</i> things to tell the rest of the team about, so I started completing outstanding tasks just to have something to report.</li>
    <li>the more I posted on the Slack channel, the more others started to do the same... at first, it was just replies to my posts, but slowly the Slack channel became quite active with people talking about what they were doing on the project.</li>
  </ol>
